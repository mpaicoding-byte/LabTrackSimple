# User Stories — Profile Completion (DOB + Gender)

## US1 — New Owner Completion
As a new user who just signed up, I want to complete my DOB and gender after my first login so I can proceed into the app.

## US2 — Returning User With Missing Data
As a returning user who skipped or failed the profile completion, I want to be prompted again until I finish my DOB and gender.

## US3 — Edit Own Profile Later
As an owner, I want to edit my own DOB and gender later from People management in case I made a mistake.

## US4 — Error Handling
As a user, I want clear error feedback if saving my profile fails so I know what to fix or try again.
